New Outline For Paper
=====================

**Thesis:** Utilizing data validation and data verification within the
server-client model to protect against potentially harmful client input.

* Introduction

    * The client-server model
    * Why to use the client-server model
    * How the client accesses the server
    * How the server talks to clients
    * Never trust the client

* Data validation (Will include images representing
  validation process)

    * What is data validation
    * Why we validate data
    * How we validate data


* Data validation in practice (will include code
  representing possible validation examples)

    * Server-side validation
    * Server-side validation examples
    * Client-side validation
    * Client-side validation examples
    * Reasons for using both server and client validation
    * Data validation isn not enough alone


* Data verification (will include images)

    * What is data verification
    * Why we verify data
    * How we verify data


* Data verification in practice (will include code)

    * Client-side verification
    * Client-side verification examples
    * Server side verification
    * Server side verification examples
    * Pros and cons to verification methods
    * Why data verification and data validation should work together


* Conclusion (will include citations)

    * The Client-server model is prevalent today
    * The client-server model has vulnerabilities
    * Data verification and data validation can help mitigate these
      vulnerabilities
